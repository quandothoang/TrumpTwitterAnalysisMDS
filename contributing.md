## Error Checking and Quality Assurance

During development, **ChatGPT was used to help identify errors, clarify expected behaviours, and check logic in data cleaning and analysis code**.  
All outputs and fixes were manually reviewed by the project authors before inclusion.  
Feel free to use similar tools for guidance, but always verify the correctness of the final output.
